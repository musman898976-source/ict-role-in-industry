    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a vital role in transforming
        traditional industries into intelligent, automated, and data-driven systems.
        ICT integrates computing systems, communication networks, automation tools,
        and data analytics to improve productivity, quality, and operational efficiency
        in industrial environments.

    <h2>4. ICT and Industry 4.0</h2>
    <p>
        Industry 4.0 represents the integration of cyber-physical systems, IoT,
        cloud computing, and artificial intelligence in manufacturing.
        ICT acts as the backbone for smart factories by enabling machine-to-machine
        communication, real-time data analysis, and intelligent decision-making.

<section id="results">
    <h2>5. Seminar and Project Results</h2>
    <p>
        The seminar and project findings indicate that industries adopting ICT solutions
        experience improved operational efficiency, reduced maintenance costs,
        and enhanced decision-making capabilities. Participants also showed
        increased understanding of digital industrial systems.

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        ICT is no longer optional for modern industries. Its implementation
        leads to sustainable growth, improved competitiveness, and readiness
        for future industrial challenges. Mechanical engineers must develop
        ICT skills to remain relevant in smart industrial environments.
